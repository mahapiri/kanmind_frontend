This project is a simple frontend built with **Vanilla JavaScript** (pure JavaScript without frameworks).

---

## Prerequisites

- A working Django backend (`KanMind`), which is **not** included in this repository.
- Visual Studio Code with the **Live Server** extension, or any tool that allows you to open the `index.html` file locally in the browser.

---

## How to Use

1. Make sure the `KanMind` backend is running.
2. Open this project in **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Right-click the `index.html` file in the root directory and select **"Open with Live Server"** to launch the project in your browser.

## Project Goals

This frontend was intentionally created using **Vanilla JavaScript** to achieve the following objectives:

- **Ease of Entry**: By avoiding frameworks like React or Angular, the code remains simple and accessible, even to those with minimal frontend experience.
- **Learning by Modifying**: Students can make small changes to better understand frontend concepts through hands-on learning.
- **Backend Extension**: This project is easily integrable with the existing Django backend [KanMind Backend](https://github.com/mahapiri/kanmind_backend.git).
